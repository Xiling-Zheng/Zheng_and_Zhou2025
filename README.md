The data generated by this program is utilized in the paper titled "Configuration of Single Giant Planet Systems Generating â€˜Oumuamua-Like Interstellar Asteroids", authored by Xiling Zheng & Jilin Zhou, published in MNRAS, 2025.

This program does not include the rebound program required for operation. If you wish to run this program, you will need to download the rebound program in C, and place the Makefile and problem.c within it to compile and run.

In the generated data.txt file, the meaning of each column of data is as follows:
0: number of planetesimal
1: initial a of planetesimal
2-10: a of planetesimal at different time points
11-19: e of planetesimal at different time points
20-28: i of planetesimal at different time points
29-37: category (1: survived 2: scattered 3: collide with star 4: collide with planet)
38: minimum distance between planetesimal and star
39: minimum distance between planetesimal and planet
40: a_final of planetesimal
41: e_final of planetesimal
42: i_final of planetesimal
43: x_final of planetesimal
44: y_final of planetesimal
45: z_final of planetesimal
46: vx_final of planetesimal
47: vy_final of planetesimal
48: vz_final of planetesimal
49: x_final of planet
50: y_final of planet
